Gambling Hotels

Welcome to Gambling Hotels! Inspiration for this came from my local interests in blackjack, with a bet always made to my friends that if we win big, we will book a hotel for the night and enjoy ourselves for another day. Although that day has not come yet, this is a mock hotel reservation app that runs on Ruby on Rails. It offers rooms from two different and popular casino hotels at current prices. Once you have registered, either through my site or GitHub, you can reserve as many rooms as you want, as long as that room type is available.
